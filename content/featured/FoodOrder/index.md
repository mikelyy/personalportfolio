Implemented Rest API via Spring MVC including registration, menu searching and ordering, checkout, etc. Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage. Provided both authentication and authorization via Spring Security. Built the client side with ReactJS to allow users to add items to the shopping cart and place orders.
